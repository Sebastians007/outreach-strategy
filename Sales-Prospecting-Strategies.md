## Claude Code Prompts

Have Claude code build you a visual that goes based off your flow tell it to replicate n8n. Something like:

> "Review my agentic workflow and build me a React-based visual dashboard that parses my terminal logs. I want it to replicate the n8n canvas style so I can see real-time state changes and execution paths as the code runs."

This way you get flows and benefits of Claude code but the visuals that help you.

## LinkedIn DM Strategies

**Source:** https://x.com/freddiexpott/status/2016218599158120570

### The Problem: Template Fatigue

A sales director at a Series C company showed me his LinkedIn DM dashboard:
- **Sent:** 1,847 messages last month
- **Booked:** 9 meetings
- **Conversion:** 0.5% (industry average is 2-3%)

**Their template:**
```
"Hi [name], saw you're in [industry]. We help companies like yours with [generic value prop]. Worth a quick call to discuss how we can help you achieve [vague outcome]?"
```

**Timeline:**
- 2023: 4% reply rate
- 2024: 0.5% reply rate
- 2025: Basically spam

**Why it failed:** Everyone copied the same template. Buyers see this message 47 times per week. Their brain auto-deletes it.

### The Solution: Warm Signal Targeting

**Strategy:**
1. Find prospects who commented on competitor posts in last 7 days
2. They're actively researching your category right now

**Message template:**
```
"[name], saw your comment on [competitor]'s post about [specific topic]. We ran into the same challenge at [similar company], ended up solving it by [specific approach]. Saved the team 6 weeks. Happy to share what worked if useful."
```

**Key principles:**
- No pitch
- No "we help companies like yours"
- Just: "I saw your problem, here's what worked for us"

**Results:**
- **Sent:** 40 warm messages
- **Replies:** 14 (35% reply rate)
- **Meetings:** 4 booked

**Comparison:**
- 1,847 generic messages = 9 meetings
- 40 specific messages = 4 meetings
- **214x better efficiency**

**Key insight:** Your reply rate isn't a volume problem, it's a relevance problem.

## Viral Marketing

### Video Strategy: 803K Views Overnight

**Source:** https://x.com/romanbuildsaas/status/2015068930876772677

**Results:** Hundreds of customers from one viral video

**Playbook:**

1. **Build something with viral DNA**
   - Your product needs a "wait, what?" factor

2. **Invest in a scroll-stopping video**
   - Motion design, cinematic demos, or bold take
   - They paid $3K (worth it)

3. **Hook into what's hot right now**
   - They used Claude Code
   - Trends do half the work

4. **Write a strong CTA**
   - Create a knowledge gap
   - No lazy "check this out"

5. **Force early momentum**
   - RTs in the first 30 minutes matter
   - Next time: paid influencer RTs

6. **Reply to every comment**
   - Tedious but mandatory
   - The algo loves it

7. **Pin a clear CTA comment**
   - Your video gets seen
   - Your link must convert

**Why most people fail:** They go viral… then disappear. Views without conversion = vanity metrics.

**Final lesson:** Virality + system = customers

**Secret:** Include a lead magnet in follow-up sequence with direct link to start a trial. People get value first, THEN they try the product.

**Time investment:** 30 minutes/week instead of 5 hours/day

**Key insight:** If you're still doing manual outreach in 2026, you're wasting your time. Automate the boring stuff. Focus on closing deals and building product.

## Lead Magnets

**Source:** https://x.com/AdamrahmanGTM/status/2015903602909364738

### Cold Email Lead Magnets That Actually Work

1. Case study doc/video
2. Personalized funnel audit doc/video
3. Short <5-min product demo video
4. Free part of service offering
5. Valuable webinar funnel

**Note:** The shorter and more digestible the lead magnet, typically the better. Very long lead magnets typically go overlooked by prospects.

## Follow-Up Strategies

**Source:** https://x.com/AdamrahmanGTM/status/2016265993635693014

### Stop Following Up with "Hi John???"

No prospect wants to see another desperate follow-up in their inbox.

**Instead, add leads to a "Nurturing Ecosystem" where you:**
- Email sales assets
- Connect on LinkedIn
- Warm call
- Retarget with ads

**Key principle:** Send value & insights, not spam.

## Relevant Messaging Framework

### Answer These Questions to Write Relevant Cold Email Messaging

7. How specifically did you help for that similar customer/client?
8. What callout can you make that would capture their attention?
9. What's a one-time offer we can offer them that would be hard to say no to?

Use these data points to create unique messaging variants.

## Quick Start Guide

### How to Book Meetings with Cold Email in Under 24 Hours

**Source:** https://x.com/AdamrahmanGTM/status/2013663824247730359

**Setup:**
1. Buy aged domains from skipwarmup.com (skip the 2-week warmup)
2. Create 50/50 Gsuite + Microsoft inbox setup
3. Import to EmailBison
4. Pull your closed deals and enrich for titles, industries, headcount, descriptions
5. Feed to Claude and ask: "What patterns do my buyers have in common?"
6. Build a scoring prompt from that - test it by mixing in real customers (if it fails on a known buyer, your prompt sucks)
7. Pull all companies matching those industries + headcounts from Apollo (or Google Maps if targeting local)
8. Run scraped companies through Llama batch API to score ICP fit (batch + caching makes this dirt cheap)
9. Run qualified leads through /enrich waterfall: LeadMagic → Prospeo → Icypeas
10. Write scripts under 50 words, one spintax every 3-5 words
11. Launch at 5-10 emails/day/inbox
12. Connect Slack via n8n for replies
13. Respond in under 5 minutes

**Key insight:** Stop guessing which segments to target. Your CRM already has the answer - you just need to extract the pattern and score new companies against it.

## Market Segmentation

### What Outbound Approach to Use Based on TAM Size

**Source:** https://x.com/AdamrahmanGTM/status/2012345388292816901

#### <10,000 Contacts
**Approach:** Manual ABM

- Hyper-personalized email
- Calling
- LinkedIn outreach
- Fight for every deal
- Retarget with ads

**Note:** Automated mass email doesn't make sense here.

#### 10,000-100,000 Contacts
**Approach:** Automated outbound with hyper-relevance

- Clay enrichment makes sense at this scale
- Credit costs are manageable
- Personalization pays off

#### 100,000+ Contacts
**Approach:** Volume game

- Focus on deliverability, offer, and sales systems
- Don't over-engineer personalization
- Segment for relevance
- Test messaging rapidly
- Let the numbers work

**Key principle:** Your TAM size determines your strategy. Don't run mass outbound with 5,000 total contacts.
