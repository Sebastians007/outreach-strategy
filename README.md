## 📧 Email Template Structure

### **The Winning Formula:**

```
Subject: how's the calendar looking {FirstName}

Hey {FirstName},

How are you getting new clients right now?

Most companies I talk to say referrals and networking.
Which is great, until there's a slow month and nothing's
coming in.

I can help {CompanyName} get more meetings with
{specific target audience for their industry}.

Let's talk this week?

Sebastian
```

### **Psychological Triggers Used:**

<table>
<tr>
<td>

1. **Loss Aversion**
   - "slow month and nothing's coming in"

2. **Social Proof**
   - "Most companies I talk to"

3. **Certainty & Confidence**
   - "I can help [Company]"

4. **Specificity**
   - Industry-specific targets

</td>
<td>

5. **Pattern Interrupt**
   - Question-based opening

6. **Direct CTA**
   - "Let's talk this week?"

7. **Authority Positioning**
   - Confident, helpful tone

## 📈 Optimization Tips

### **What's Working:**

✅ **Subject Lines**
- "how's the calendar looking {FirstName}" → 42% open rate
- Personal, lowercase, casual tone

✅ **Opening Questions**
- "How are you getting new clients right now?" → High engagement
- Forces self-reflection

✅ **Loss Framing**
- "slow month and nothing's coming in" → Triggers action
- Specific, relatable pain

✅ **Direct CTAs**
- "Let's talk this week?" → Better than "worth a call?"
- Assumes the close

### **What to Avoid:**

❌ Generic templates ("I help companies like yours")
❌ Soft CTAs ("Let me know if you're interested")
❌ Too much detail (ownership explanation removed)
❌ Formal tone (use conversational language)
