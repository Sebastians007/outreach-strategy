# Lead Magnet Strategy for SalesFlo (Management Consultants)

**Target ICP:** Management consultants targeting Financial Services, Telecom, Media, Tech, Healthcare, and Pharma companies

**Date:** January 28, 2026

---

## The Problem

Most management consultants are drowning in people trying to sell them stuff. They get the same "we help companies like yours" garbage 50 times a week. Their brain is literally trained to delete it.

---

## What Actually Works

### Strategy #1: Just Give Them Leads

**The Play:**

Pull 30 Financial Services CFOs who commented on something relevant in the last two weeks, throw it in a Google Sheet, and say:

> "Hey, these people are looking for consulting help right now, want the list?"

**Why This Works:**

- You did work for them already (before they even asked)
- It's useful TODAY, not some PDF they'll never read
- It proves you can actually find their ideal clients
- Zero risk for them to say yes

**The Follow-Up:**

Send the list, then 3 days later:

> "Hey did you reach out to any of those CFOs? We basically do this on repeat for consulting firms - find 100+ people like this every month and get meetings with them. Want to see how?"

That's it. No fancy blueprint. No 47-page PDF they won't open. Just "here's free leads, by the way we can do this at scale if you want."

---

### Strategy #2: Call Out What's Broken

**The Email:**

> "Hey [name], looked at your website. I can tell exactly why your Financial Services outreach isn't working. Want me to record a quick video showing what's wrong and how to fix it?"

**Why People Love This:**

1. You're calling out a real problem they have
2. You're offering to help for free
3. It's personalized to THEM, not some generic template

Most consultants are smart enough to know their outreach sucks, they just don't know why. You show them why + how to fix it, they're gonna want to work with you.

## The Golden Rule

**Don't make them work for it.**

- Don't make them download something
- Don't make them sign up
- Don't make them sit through a webinar

**Just give them the thing.**

## The Real Talk Version

Here's the thing most people get wrong about lead magnets:

They think it needs to be this big, fancy thing. A 47-page guide. A comprehensive blueprint. Some massive value bomb.

Nope.

**The best lead magnet is just doing a small version of your service for free.**

You help consultants get meetings with Financial Services companies? Great. Find them 30 Financial Services companies and hand over the list.

You help them write better outreach? Great. Write them one good email and explain why it works.

You help them identify their ideal prospects? Great. Show them exactly who their ideal prospects are.

**Stop trying to educate them. Just help them.**

The consultants who will pay you $5K/month don't need another PDF. They need results. Give them a taste of results, and they'll pay for more.
